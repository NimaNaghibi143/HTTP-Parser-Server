# HTTP-Parser-Server
Introduction:
I’m about to start a fun project where I build an HTTP parser and server from scratch using the Go programming language. I won’t be using the net/http package, because I want to build everything myself. However, I will use the TCP library, since HTTP is built on top of TCP.

By the time I finish this project, I will have learned a lot about HTTP not only from a theoretical perspective, but also from a practical and technical standpoint.
